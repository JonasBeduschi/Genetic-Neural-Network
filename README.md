## What is this project
Made on free time, it is an experimentation on Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. Long story short: The little guys "evolve" to navigate the map

## How to use it?
Download Unity and clone/download the repo and open the project! You'll see a single scene that can be used as is or changed.

## Goals
I will be updating this for easy of usage and clarity when possible. Making it easily costumizable and simple to use are the goals, so it can be used in a variety of different games and experiments.
